# n8n Weather Workflow

This project is a simple weather-fetching automation built using [n8n](https://n8n.io/), a fair-code licensed workflow automation tool. It connects to the OpenWeatherMap API to retrieve current weather data for a city and stores the results on a Google Sheet

## Features

- 🌍 Fetches real-time weather data from OpenWeatherMap
- 🏙️ Configurable city input (currently hardcoded for demonstration)
- 🌡️ Returns temperature, weather conditions, and timestamp
- 🔄 Easy to extend for multiple cities or dynamic input (e.g., from Google Sheets or Webhooks)

## Setup
